This is an experiment long in the making. It consists of the following ingredients:
* 1x Magic: The Gathering card
* 1x counterfeit version of the same card
* 1x jewler's loupe
* 1x quality flashlight

Here are the results:

This is the real deal:
![actual card]({{ "/assets/img/real_led.jpg" | absolute_url }})
Look at that crisp '0'.

This is the imitation:
![fake card]({{ "/assets/img/fake_led.jpg" | absolute_url }})
:(

and here are the tools:
![jeweller's loupe]({{ "/assets/img/loupe.jpg" | absolute_url }})

![flashlight]({{ "/assets/img/flashlight.jpg" | absolute_url }})
[a decent flashlight](http://www.eagletac.com/html/d25aaa/specs.html)

This is the EAGTAC D25AAA. It's one of the cheapest flashlights you can get with a quality, high color rating index LED. There are versions available with the CREE XP-G2, but I like the Nichia 219 version for the better color. Fun fact: It also has a magnet on the back. :)

Most certainly overkill, but it's part of my everyday carry anywho, and the LED on the loupe doesn't really cut the mustard for the light test.
